# Demystifying complex patterns: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) vs Clustering
Scenario based comparison study demonstrating where TDA could help to capture the intricate patterns of complex non-linear data. 

Python code implementation on a representative dataset, the [swiss roll dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_swiss_roll.html) shared.
